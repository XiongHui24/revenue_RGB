      <p>
      Coronavirus disease a.k.a. COVID – 19. I believe this disease is not unfamiliar to everyone. It has shocked everyone in the world by how fast it can spread from one to another. Though the fatality rate is low, the virus can be transmitted more easily among people compared to other well known viruses i.e. SARS and MERS. Started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, it has spread to different regions around the world in just 4 months from 31 December 2019. To contain the virus from spreading to other provinces, China has declared lockdown and all the citizens are restricted to step out from their home. The world economic has severely affected due to the lockdown it stops both imports and exports of goods. Companies trading with their counterparties in China is halted and indirectly affect their businesses. Goods unable to be delivered on time causing short of supplies. Proceeds from exporting is delayed as importers are unable to clear goods from cargo. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, outbreak occurred and Thailand has recorded the first COVID-19 case outside of China. Slowly, more and more countries were reported to detect COVID-19 including Malaysia. Considering the safety of Malaysian citizens and to stop the virus from spreading, Malaysian government has officially announced the lock down starting on 18 March 2020 as the first approach to fight the pandemic disease. All businesses except essential businesses such as restaurants, F&B companies and supermarket were ordered to close down during the first phase of lockdown (18 March – 31 March) and Movement Control Order (MCO) came into the picture. To date, MCO has extended for the fourth round and is expected to end on 12th May 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
      COVID-19 has definitely affected not only Malaysia’s but the world’s economy. SMEs barely survived with tight cash flow although stimulus package is announced to lighten the burden. Unemployment rate increases due to laid off by companies that chose to cut head counts. Things are bad since the starting of year 2020. So, this has come to the topic of the day. How will this pandemic disease affects performance of companies. The company chosen for today’s topic is REVENUE GROUP BERHAD.

      <p>Revenue Group Berhad is a player in electronic payments industry in Malaysia since 2003. Their revenue stream comes from 3 segments which are sales of EDC Terminals, Electronic Transaction Processing and providing solution and services. Besides, they have a flagship platform named revPAY that provides connectivity between front-end to back-end solutions. This platform supports multiple channel which includes EDC Terminal, E-commerce and QR code payment and this provides flexibility to the end users to choose different payment methods.</p>
      <p>The above diagram shows the principal activities and the revenue derivation from each segment. Revenue Group generates rental income or sales of EDC terminals and also the monthly maintenance fee. Besides, the group also earns Net Discount Merchant Rate (MDR) for processing electronic transactions from both physical transactions and e-commerce/mobile channel. On top of that, in order to add value for their customers, the group also provides solution and services in relation of payment gateway, payment network security and payment infrastructure.</p>

      <p>So, after learning their business model, how will their revenue affected by COVID-19?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Due to lockdown and MCO, some retailers unable to operate starting from 18 March especially those shops in shopping mall. The group’s main target customer is high end fashion retailers in malls. Net MDR earned might be lower compared to previous quarters.</li>
        <li>The group may not be able to sell and rent out more EDC terminals for the time being since businesses are having a hard time. Some SMEs may have chosen to close down and new start-ups might decrease due to the uncertainty of economy. This will affect the group’s revenue in selling and renting equipment. Inventories will increase to a higher level.</li>
        <li>Fluctuation of USD/MYR is also a concern since the physical terminals are purchased using USD. As Malaysian Ringgit depreciates, it might cause a higher cost of goods sold for EDC terminal segment.</li>
        <li>4.	Since cash flow is tighten for all the business owners, they might choose not to pay for their terminal purchased on time. The group may choose to grant longer credit term to them, and may cause higher trade receivables and level of bad debts.</li>

      <p>Today’s focus will be on the expectation on changes in revenue. Sales and rental of EDC Terminals is always the biggest chunk from the total revenue. ETF recorded higher percentage from total revenue in year 2018, which is 37%. This may be due to the sales of EDC Terminals in 2018 was not that high compared to recent years. Solution and services segment remains constant at approximately 18% throughout 2018 to second quarter of 2020. Moving forward, I do expect the ETF segment will slightly affected by MCO since it still has e-commerce/mobile commerce platform to generate income. The revenue on sales and rental of EDC terminals is expected to drop.</p>

      <p>Profit margin for EDC Terminals dropped gradually since 2018. This might be due to depreciation of MYR against USD since the terminals are purchased in USD. Profit margin for both ETP and Solution and Services do not fluctuate too much throughout the years. </p> 
      <p>The coming quarter which is third quarter, impact of MCO will not be heavily reflected as the impact on business is only within 18 March to 31 March. However, the focus will be on the fourth quarter report as it will reflect the close down in all businesses for whole April. Due to the uncertainty and severity of the impact, it is hard to estimate how much the revenue will drop. However, ETF is a segment that can offset the negative impact on sales and rental of EDC terminals as people are more actively using online platform/e-commerce to purchase their needs. The profit margin for this segment is expected to be constant and this is a good sign that it is not affected by the MCO. These are my expectation on the revenue and how I reach my profit after tax.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-5 w3-justify">
      <p>EDC Terminal revenue is estimated using 2nd quarter’s total which is RM 21.142mil. Since the lock down is almost 2 months, rough estimation to calculate this is to divide RM21.142mil by 6 and multiple by 10 to get RM 35.24mil. ETP segment is expected to drop by approximately 9% compared to 2019’s figures since the e-commerce net MDR can make up for the lost from physical terminal. For Solution and services, I have followed Bank Negara’s GDP growth of -2% to 0.5% as a conservative estimation. Other income, administrative expenses and finance cost is expected to be double of 2nd quarter’s figure. Taxation is estimated at 24% and profit after tax is expected to be approximate RM 8.72 mil, -4.5% compared to year 2019.</p>
      <p>These are some of my opinions in estimating the full year revenue of Revenue Group Berhad. Overall, the group’s revenue will definitely impacted by the lock down and MCO. However, the cash flow of the group remains strong as it is a net cash company. Therefore, the group should not be facing tight cash flow during these unfavourable condition.The future outlook for this company is promising as cashless payment is the future.</p>
      <p>** This is not a buy sell call. It is subject to my personal opinion and my own justification.</p>
